        <h1 class="top" id="home_h1"> We are Arctic Monkeys</h1>
        <p class="home_p">Arctic Monkeys was originally formed in 2002 by four friends. Alex Turner, Matt Helders, Jamie Cook, and Andy Nicholson. Alex, Jamie and Matt were neighbours and close friends, and they met Andy in secondary school and played together in their teens. </p>
        <p class="home_p"> They were later inspired by the local music scene and began performing together in pubs. They soon gained popularity through word of mouth and the rise of social media. This allowed them to build a fanbase before signing with a record label and releasing their first album. </p>

        <!--This section of code is meant to have an image and short description of each band member-->
