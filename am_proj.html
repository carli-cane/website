        <p class="proj_p">While involved with Arctic Monkeys some members have been apart of multiple other projects and bands. Whether this be a one time collab, releasing full albums, singles or EPs, or being involved in another band at the same time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="proj_p">Alex Turner was first involved in Arctic Monkeys. In 2007 he announced a side-project band called "The Last Shadow Puppets" where he worked along side Miles Kane who he had befriended in 2005. They released 5 EPs and 2 albums the last of which being released in 2016. Alex has also produced solo music. He released one song in 2008 and made music for the film "Submarine" in 2010.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="proj_p">Matt Helders has been featured in a variety of different songs for his drumming and part of his vocals, including "Everything You've Come To Expect" by The Last Shadow Puppets and "Diamond Heart" by Lady Gaga. He has been in the band Mongrel since 2008. He also released a solo album titled "Late Night Talks: Matt Helders" in 2008.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="proj_p">Andy Nicholson was one of the founders of Mongrel. He was in the band "Lords of Flatbush" but left to concertrate on Mongrel. He then took over as bassist in the band "The Book Club" in 2009 but left in 2010 to join "Reverend and The Makers". Currently, he is making and producing in the HipHop group Clubs & Spades. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="proj_p">Jamie Cook has only been involved in Arctic Monkeys. However, if you google what bands he is in it comes up with "Death Ramps". This is Arctic Monkeys alias and they often use this alias when producing music with Miles Kane and Richard Hawley. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="proj_p">Nick O'Malley is similar to Jamie Cook having only been in the band Arctic Monkeys and being a part of their alias band Death Ramps.</p>
